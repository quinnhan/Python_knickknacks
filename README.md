Just some random small code that I think of over time

# SQL_render: 1/22/2022 
I recently moved to a job that is not using SQL (my bad during the interview about this part). I certainly do not want to lose this skill and I need practice regardless. There are multiple ways of doing, and I decide to use Kaggle data for my purpose. Most of Kaggle data come in csv form and I dont want to retype thousands of data points into DB Fiddle. Also, redundant tasks can always be taken care by a machine. 

This code will take a path to a csv file and render out a text file with the same name in the same folder
